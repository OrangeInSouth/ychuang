I'm a Ph.d. student in Research Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT, China). My research interests focus on Natural Language Processing, Text Generation, Neural Machine Translation and Knowledge Distillation. Specially, I'm interested in improving multilingual neural machine translation.
