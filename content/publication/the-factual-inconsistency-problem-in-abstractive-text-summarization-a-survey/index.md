abstract: "Recently, various neural encoder-decoder models pioneered by Seq2Seq
  framework have been proposed to achieve the goal of generating more
  abstractive summaries by learning to map input text to output text. At a high
  level, such neural models can freely generate summaries without any constraint
  on the words or phrases used. Moreover, their format is closer to human-edited
  summaries and output is more readable and ﬂuent. However, the neural model’s
  abstraction ability is a double-edged sword. A commonly observed problem with
  the generated summaries is the distortion or fabrication of factual
  information in the article. This inconsistency between the original text and
  the summary has caused various concerns over its applicability, and the
  previous evaluation methods of text summarization are not suitable for this
  issue. In response to the above problems, the current research direction is
  predominantly divided into two categories, one is to design fact-aware
  evaluation metrics to select outputs without factual inconsistency errors, and
  the other is to develop new summarization systems towards factual consistency.
  In this survey, we focus on presenting a comprehensive review of these
  fact-speciﬁc evaluation methods and text summarization models. "
