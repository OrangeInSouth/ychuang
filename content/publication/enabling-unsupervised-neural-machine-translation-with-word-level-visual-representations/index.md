abstract: Unsupervised neural machine translation has recently made remarkable
  strides, achieving impressive results with the exclusive use of monolingual
  corpora. Nonetheless, these methods still exhibit fundamental flaws, such as
  confusing similar words. A straightforward remedy to rectify this drawback is
  to employ bilingual dictionaries, however, high-quality bilingual dictionaries
  can be costly to obtain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a method that
  incorporates images at the word level to augment the lexical mappings.
  Specifically, our method inserts visual representations into the model,
  modifying the corresponding embedding layer information. Besides, a visible
  matrix is adopted to isolate the impact of images on other unrelated words.
  Experiments on the Multi30k dataset with over 300,000 self-collected images
  validate the effectiveness in generating more accurate word translation,
  achieving an improvement of up to 2.81 BLEU score, which is comparable or even
  superior to using bilingual dictionaries.
